SlackBuild for eggdrop 1.8.0_20160503

You can export the EGG_HANDLEN environmental variable to set an allowed
nicklength other than the default of 32 by specifying
  EGG_HANDLEN=9
when you run the script.

Likewise, if your eggdrop user isn't named "eggdrop", specify its name like
this:
  EGG_USER="foobar"

Speaking of the eggdrop user, you will need to add it:
  groupadd -g 325 eggdrop
  useradd -u 325 -g 325 -d /opt/eggdrop-1.8.0_20160503 eggdrop

One more variable to consider is
  EGG_SSLCERT="yes"
which, if set to "yes", will also run `make sslcert`, which is recommended if
you plan to use your bot as a botnet hub.

Before starting the eggdrop, you'll need to edit the configuration file for it
in /opt/eggdrop-1.8.0/eggdrop.conf. It should be executable and point to the
eggdrop binary in its #! line so that the /etc/rc.d/rc.eggdrop script will be
able to run it. Also note that the pidfile should be called eggdrop.pid if you
want the /etc/rc.d/rc.eggdrop script to be able to interact with it.

It is suggested you add this to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:

    # /etc/rc.d/rc.local
    # ==================
    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.eggdrop ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.eggdrop start
    fi

that way, the eggdrop will start when you boot.
